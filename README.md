# Ecological-FruitFly-Surveillance
A spatially explicit simulation and surveillance optimization framework for fruit fly population monitoring and ecological risk assessment.

---

## Project Overview

This project develops a spatially explicit modelling and simulation framework to evaluate surveillance strategies for fruit fly population detection and monitoring.

The framework integrates:

- Landscape-level spatial structure
- Fruit fly population dynamics
- Trap/grid surveillance design
- Distance-based detection probability
- Repeated stochastic simulations

The objective is to evaluate how spatial heterogeneity influences surveillance efficiency and pest detection probability.

## Scientific Context

The modelling approach is informed by:

- Triska (2018), *Pest Management Science*  
- Spatially heterogeneous surveillance theory  
- Grid-based trap placement design  
- Stochastic simulation of pest spread  

The project aims to explore:

- Detection probability under different grid densities  
- Spatial risk concentration  
- Surveillance design optimization
