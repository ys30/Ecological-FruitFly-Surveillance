## Script Pipeline

The modelling workflow follows this sequence:

1. `01_fruitfly_population.R`
   - Generates fruit fly population spatial distribution.

2. `02_calc_distances.R`
   - Computes spatial distances between traps and population points.

3. `03_make_grid_design.R`
   - Generates surveillance grid designs.

4. `04_run_sim.R`
   - Runs a single stochastic simulation.

5. `05_run_many_sims.R`
   - Performs repeated simulation iterations.

6. `06_show_design.R`
   - Visualizes surveillance layout and detection zones.

7. `07_plot_hist_density.R`
   - Produces histograms and density plots for simulation results.
